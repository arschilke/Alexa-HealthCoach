## What it does
* Boost self-confidence 
* Provide fitness and health knowledge
* Advise specific workouts to do
    - Cardio
    - Abs
    - Upper Body
    - Lower Body
* Strive to improve achievement drive
* Spread optimism

## How we built it
1. Researching Amazon Web Services and Alexa Skill Developer
2. Test Driven Development: 
Using the Alexa Skill developer creating commands:
    a) Exercise Options: cardio, upper body, lower body, abs
    b) Motivation
    c) Health Facts
3. Connect AWS Lambda code (.js) to the Skill Developer
4. Test!

## Challenges we ran into
-To display the userâ€™s health data based on exercise, food intake, and medicine. 
provide this data using graphs
-To program a unique and special curated music playlist geared toward health and fitness, different from the one Alexa can already do

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our alexa skill exists!!!

## What we learned
So much!...We were challenged to figure out JavaScript, Alexa Skill Developer, and AWS Lambda. 

## What's next for Health Coach
We plan to have Health Coach track habits from the Apple Health device in order to have the skill communicate necessary activities.
